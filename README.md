# WindowsFixer
A collection of minimal tweaks to make Win11/10 less crappy, all provided as standalone .reg or other full-source files

There are an infinite number of Apps for tweaking Windows, but I don't really trust them, as they require deep/full access to your system and don't show their work. 

Instead this is a collection of .REG files, or short & simple batch files that you can easily inspect for full transparency before applying. No app is included, all that ties this together is long, fully descriptive filenames.

Note that since PowerShell is persnickety about offering double click support for downloaded files, the powershell based tweaks are just plain text files to be copied and pasted into an admin prompt. They all end in PS.txt
